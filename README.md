This repository contains the source code for an examination system application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This system allows users (students) to register, log in, take exams, view results, and encounter a time-out page if the exam duration is exceeded.


Features:

-Registration: Users can create new accounts with relevant details.

-Login: Registered users can log in to access exams.

-Exams: The system supports conducting timed examinations.

-Results: Users can view their exam results after completion.

-Time-Out: The system enforces a time limit, displaying a time-out page if exceeded.


I was primarily responsible for developing the following components:

-Registration Page (registration.js): Implemented user registration functionality, ensuring secure data collection and storage.

-Login Page (login.js): Developed user login functionality, including authentication logic.

-Results Page (results.js): Created the logic to retrieve, process, and display exam results to users.

-Time-Out Page (timeout.js): Implemented the time-out mechanism, displaying a dedicated page when the exam duration ends.
